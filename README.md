# 🧠 Steves Knowledge:  Markdown based Second Brain Systems Using Obsidian

# Introduction
This repo contains what are essentially wikis constructed using Markdown files. 

I am using the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) tool to construct these repos. 

# Repositories 

 * [KnowledgeSystems](https://github.com/stevesKnowledge/KnowledgeSystems) - Information on Constructing and Organizing this type of System, and the Obsidian tool
 * [KnowledgeSoftware](https://github.com/stevesKnowledge/KnowledgeSoftware) - Notes on Software Development

Refer to the Readme on Knowledge Systems for more information about the why and how. 

# Pros And Cons of Markdown Based Second Brain Systems 
**Advantages** 
 * **Text Based** These systems have the advantage of keeping your data in text format where it is not linked to any proprietary format.    Additionally, as a software developer, I am already familiar with  Markdown, so that is natural to me. 
 * **Zettelkasten Systems** Zettelkasten systems are are a form of indexeing and linking documents while also providing references to original source material.  Zettelkastens precede the internet, and are a predecessor of both HTML and Wikis.
 * **Publishable** Tools like Obsidian have the capability of publishing Notes from this system directly to a web page. 

**Disadvantages**
 * **Markdown Limitations** Many things in markdown are cumbersome when compared to other tools, such as creating and editing tables.  Obsidian and other tools are gaining ground, but there is still a learning curve for markdown.
